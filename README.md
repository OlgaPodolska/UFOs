Dynamic web page with table from JavaScript array

I built a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, created filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it react to user input. It is allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time: date, city, state, country, and shape.

Then I placed the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. I customized my webpage using Bootstrap, and equip my table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations.
